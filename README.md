# British-Airline-Reviews
 I recently engaged in a job simulation with British Airways on the Forage platform, gaining valuable insights into the experience of being part of their Data Science team. During the simulation, I analyzed customer insights and developed a predictive model to explore factors influencing purchasing behavior. Utilizing a Jupyter Notebook, I honed my data analytics skills and enhanced my presentation and communication abilities by conveying insights in a real-world context. This experience affirmed my passion for leveraging data to offer business insights, and I am enthusiastic about applying these skills in a Data Science role, particularly at a company like British Airways.
